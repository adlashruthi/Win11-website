        Win 11 was the first company in India to introduce the concept of
        Fantasy sports. Co-founders Harsh Jain and Bhavit Sheth started Win 11
        in 2008. In 2012, they launched a freemium model of Fantasy cricket in
        India. Two years later, there were 1 million registered users on the
        app, which ballooned to 45 million in 2018. At present, there are over
        140 million registered users on the app. The industry has grown
        massively since then.
