        Just what is this thing called "fantasy football"? To play fantasy
        football, you assemble a virtual team of 11 players and compete against
        other fantasy players online. It is up to you, the player, to select the
        best 11 players across four positions (midfielder, goalkeeper, defender,
        and striker) to help your team earn the most points possible.

        The team's captain and vice captain can then be chosen. It is crucial to
        select the top players for the roles of captain and vice-captain, as
        their contributions to the team's performance are worth double the
        fantasy points for the captain and 1.5 times as much for the
        vice-captain. The user with the most points at the end of the match is
        the victor.

        Practice is the key to success in fantasy football, as it is a game of
        skill. Before settling on your virtual team, it's also wise to do some
        in-depth study and research.
